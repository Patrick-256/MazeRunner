//2021-06-30 This is my very first attempt at programming a neural network
//           The goal of this program is to:
//           1. Create my own game (the maze) and each tick will present possible moves to the player (the nueral network)
//           2. Create a neural network that will decide where to move to based in its current location and possible options to move to
//           3. Create some sort of learning algorigthm that will modify the neural network to make it learn
